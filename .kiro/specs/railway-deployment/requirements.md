# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the SMS MCP server to be deployed to Railway as a remote MCP server accessible via HTTP transport instead of the current stdio transport. This will allow the MCP server to be used remotely by multiple clients and provide better scalability and accessibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the MCP server to Railway, so that I can access SMS functionality remotely without running a local server.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is deployed to Railway THEN it SHALL be accessible via HTTP transport
2. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL listen on the PORT environment variable provided by Railway
3. WHEN the server receives HTTP requests THEN it SHALL handle MCP protocol messages over HTTP
4. WHEN Railway builds the project THEN it SHALL use the npm build script to compile TypeScript
5. WHEN Railway starts the server THEN it SHALL use the compiled JavaScript entry point

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Railway to automatically build and deploy the server, so that I don't need to manually compile or configure the deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Railway detects changes THEN it SHALL automatically trigger a new build
2. WHEN Railway builds the project THEN it SHALL install dependencies and run the build script
3. WHEN the build completes THEN Railway SHALL start the server using the correct entry point
4. IF the build fails THEN Railway SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL be accessible at the Railway-provided URL

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the deployed server to maintain all existing SMS functionality, so that remote access doesn't compromise features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is accessed remotely THEN it SHALL provide the same send-message tool
2. WHEN the server is accessed remotely THEN it SHALL provide the same prompt templates
3. WHEN messages are sent THEN they SHALL use the same Twilio integration
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled the same way as the local version
5. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the server SHALL fail gracefully with clear messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Railway configuration, so that deployment is reliable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Railway deploys THEN it SHALL use the correct Node.js version (>=18)
2. WHEN Railway builds THEN it SHALL use npm as the package manager
3. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL bind to :: (IPv6) to accept external connections and support Railway's IPv6 infrastructure
4. WHEN Railway restarts the service THEN it SHALL automatically restart on crashes
5. IF the health check fails THEN Railway SHALL restart the service
